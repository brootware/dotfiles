# dotfiles ðŸ§°

My personal dotfiles to automate installing all the aliases and zsh configurations on a fresh machine ðŸ’».


## How to use

Configure git author details

```zsh
git config -f ~/.gitlocal user.email "email@yoursite.com"
git config -f ~/.gitlocal user.name "Name Lastname"
```

### To install the dotfiles

This will install the dotfiles from this repo to your `$HOME/` directory.
Run the bootstrap installation script.


```zsh
# Clone dotfiles repo and navigate into it
git clone https://github.com/brootware/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles

# Install dotfiles
./install
```

This has been tested on wsl2 running on windows 10 and should work on Mac too.

## Windows auto dark mode

You can import the XML configuration files in `win11AutoDarkMode/` folder to window task scheduler to turn on dark mode at 6:30pm and off at 7:00am.
