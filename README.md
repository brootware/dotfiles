# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

## How to use

Clone the repo. 


```zsh 
git clone https://github.com/brootware/dotfiles.git
chmod +x installdotfiles.sh
./installdotfiles.sh
```

The install script will backup all your dotfiles from `~/` directory `originaldotfiles/` folder in case something goes wrong and install all the configurations.

This has been tested on wsl2 running on windows 10 and should work on Mac too.
