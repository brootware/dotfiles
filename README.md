# dotfiles ðŸ§°

My personal dotfiles to automate installing all the aliases and zsh configurations on a fresh machine ðŸ’».


## How to use

Configure git author details

```zsh
git config global user.email "email@yoursite.com"
git config global user.name "Name Lastname"
```

### To install the dotfiles

This will install the dotfiles from this repo to your `$HOME/` directory after making a backup.
Run the bootstrap installation script.

```zsh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brootware/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh > bootstrap.sh && chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh -i
```

OR, you can download the git repo and install as below.

```zsh
# Clone dotfiles repo and navigate into it
git clone https://github.com/brootware/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles

# Install dotfiles
./install
```

This has been tested on wsl2 running on windows 10 and should work on Mac too.

## Windows auto dark mode

You can import the XML configuration files in `win11AutoDarkMode/` folder to window task scheduler to turn on dark mode at 6:30pm and off at 7:00am.
